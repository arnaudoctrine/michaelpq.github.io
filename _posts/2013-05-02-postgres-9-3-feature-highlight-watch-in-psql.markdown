psql is the native client of PostgreSQL widely used by application developers and database administrators on a daily-basis for common operations when interacting with a PostgreSQL server. With a full set of integrated functionalities, it is among the most popular (if not the number one) client applications in the Postgres community. If you are a Postgres nerd (highly possible if you are reading this page), you know that the feeling of discovering a new functionality in psql is close to the excitement you can have when opening a christmas present as you know that such a feature went though the strict community review process. The upcoming release 9.3 of Postgres is not an exception and brings a new useful command called [\watch](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/app-psql.html). This feature has been introduced by this commit:

    commit c6a3fce7dd4dae6e1a005e5b09cdd7c1d7f9c4f4

    Add \watch [SEC] command to psql.
    
    This allows convenient re-execution of commands.

Close to what \g can do when replaying the last query stored in buffer, \watch offers the possibility to replay the same query with a given interval of time as follows:

    \watch [ seconds ]

Compared to a wrapper on psql that would run repetitively the same query, \watch does not need to acquire a new connection each time the query is executed, saving some execution overhead. Also, the watch automatically stops if a failure occurs for the query.

Note that \watch can only be used at the end of the query you want to run.

    postgres=# \watch 2 "SELECT 1"

\watch cannot be used with an empty query

This error does not appear if a query is stored in buffer.

If no query is specified it will use the latest query in buffer.

    postgres=# \watch 10
    Watch every 10s	Thu May  2 13:15:14 2013
    
     ?column? 
    ----------
            1
    (1 row)

For example, simply check if your server is alive using psql:

    postgres=# select 1; \watch 1
     ?column? 
    ----------
            1
    (1 row)
    Watch every 1s	Thu May  2 13:06:53 2013
        
     ?column? 
    ----------
            1
    (1 row)
    
    server closed the connection unexpectedly
    This probably means the server terminated abnormally
     before or while processing the request.
    The connection to the server was lost. Attempting reset: Succeeded.

Oops, the connection has been closed...

Here is an other example: check every minute the latest query that ran on server.

    postgres=# SELECT datname, query, usename FROM pg_stat_activity ORDER BY query_start DESC LIMIT 1; \watch 60
     datname  |                                          query                                          | usename 
    ----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------
     postgres | SELECT datname, query, usename FROM pg_stat_activity ORDER BY query_start DESC LIMIT 1; | postgres
    (1 row)
    
                                       Watch every 60s	Thu May  2 13:40:49 2013
    
     datname  |                                          query                                          | usename 
    ----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------
     postgres | SELECT datname, query, usename FROM pg_stat_activity ORDER BY query_start DESC LIMIT 1; | postgres
    (1 row)

A last example: kill periodically backends (here every 60s) that have not been activated for a given period of time (here 30s).

    postgres=# SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) as status FROM pg_stat_activity
    postgres=# WHERE now() - state_change > interval '30 s' AND
    postgres=# pid != pg_backend_pid();
     status 
    --------
    (0 rows)
    
    postgres=# \watch 60
    Watch every 60s	Thu May  2 13:51:04 2013
    
     status 
    --------
    (0 rows)

In short, a lot of things are doable with \watch, you can automatize for example actions easily with a psql client, like the refresh of a materialized view. At least I won't need anymore to type 50 times the same query when developing an application using Postgres or creating a new feature.
