I manage my own Linux home as a GIT repository adapted for multiple
environments.

It contains emacs, bash configuration (bash alias, etc.) and scripts
used for PostgreSQL development and other extra things. All the
repositories that need to be kept private are simply ignored, allowing
to keep a mobile and flexible environment that needs just to be fetched
to be set up. This is particularly useful to deploy development VMs at
critical speed. Settings can also be kept private with some dedicated
configuration files that can be hidden from the remote repository.

Home comes as well with a module called spatch, able to manage multiple
private user profiles within a single user session. This is useful when
switching profiles within a single machine when it is not possible to have
VMs at disposition. Default and example profiles are available in
.spatch.d/. Configuration file templates for many purposes are available
in .examples (irssi, mpd, gitconfig, etc.).

The GIT repository is available in github as
[michaelpq/home](https://github.com/michaelpq/home).

You can fetch it directly with one of those commands;

    git clone https://github.com/michaelpq/home.git
    git clone git://github.com/michaelpq/home.git

Pull requests and issue reports are accepted.
